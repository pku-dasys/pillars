    "## Introduction of coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA)\n",
    "CGRA is a class of reconfigurable architecture that provides word-level granularity in a reconfigurable array to overcome some of the disadvantages of FPGAs.\n",
    "CGRAs provide the capability for spatial, temporal and parallel computation, and hence can outperform common computing systems in many applications."
